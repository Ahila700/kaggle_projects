# Kaggle Projects
---
This will just be a collection of smaller mini projects on data visualization, data analysis, etc to solve random questions using some kaggle data sets. In some cases larger data sets and outside data will also be used, as well as machine learning tools to solve the problems and better understand the data as a whole.
