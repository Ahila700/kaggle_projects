# Kaggle Projects
---
This will just be a collection of smaller mini projects on data visualization, data analysis, etc to solve random questions using some kaggle data sets. In some cases larger data sets and outside data will also be used, as well as machine learning tools to solve the problems and better understand the data as a whole.


## Pokemon Stats

In my first edit I just wanted to get the base idea down of the best pokemon by their stats. I tried to further narrow this down to organize the different pokemon by types as well. I wanted to find which types in general had the best base stats. So to do this I wanted to eliminate outliers in the data. I started by first removing all the legendaries as well as the first stage pokemon which evolved into stronger ones. This would limit the evolution chain so that typings like bug and grass weren't punished for having a ton of 3 level generations. Since most people evolve pokemon to their final evolution.

## Soccer Stats

Just a very general look at some stats for different national teams and their games over the history of soccer. Using SQL queries I was able to find the most winning national teams in all competitions, surprisingly finding that Sweden is among some giants of the national stage in the top 10. Including the teams you would expect to see like Germany, Brazil, etc.
